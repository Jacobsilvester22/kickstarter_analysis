# Analysis of Campaign Kickstarters #
Louise is excited to hear how well her play's fundraising has done thus far and has asked for us to analyize how it compares to other campaigns. Specifically to others' launch date and funding goals.

Below are the attached summaries of the data analyized. Louise's play was compared to similar campaigns of only a select subcategory of kickstarters. This could lead to challanges, as specific data she may be looking for is more relative to other campaigns. 
## Results ##
### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date ###
Overall, the most successful campaigns came in May where as the least successful came in December.

### Outcomes Based on Goals ###
Overall, there are more successful campaigns rather than failed when their funding goals are less than $20,000.

## Conclusion ##
Where are happy that Louise has found success up until this point. We hope the data we compiled is usefull to her but we would like to reccomend further analysis. With the main test we collected, we would like to point out how outlandish campaigns may lead to outliers. How there may be outide influences that lead to the results we are seeing. We suggest to further evaluate if successful campaigns has a campaign manager that has established successful campaigns prior.
